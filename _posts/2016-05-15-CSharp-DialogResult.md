## Microsoft Summer School

### Istanbul/Turkey 2016

 
                    So what is Microsoft Summer school? You will probably say a summer school organized by Microsoft 
                     Turkey!!But keep calm that is not the right definition for that. More than a simple summer school,
                     it can replace your internship, it builds bridges between students and public figures such as CEOs,
                    journalists, start-uppers, entrepreneurs and even people Microsoft technical partners. Great right..?
                      The aim of that one month of intensive “course” is to explain how fast the technology is growing, what is
                     the world waiting from young people, how to solve problems using technologies, some technical tasks 
                    (cloud system like Microsoft Azure, Xamarin Cross platform development, UI and UX, Debugging and Testing, 
                    Web and Mobile development and Architecture, IoT, 3D, Open Source development, C#, UWP and SQL, Unity, 
                    Big Data, Azure Machine Learning, Office 365….).
                    And besides those technical backgrounds participants also receive some basic information about business,
                     marketing and branding, starting-up, thinking like an entrepreneur, how to manage both technical and business 
                    part of a start-up…
                     Every day of that wonderful month starts with a speech of an inspirer who can be either a CEO, or a start-upper
                     or a journalist or even a public speaker…….at 09AM(GMT+03). The day also ends as it starts. After the speech in 
                    the morning technical classes start…You gonna ask if those guys don’t even rest??Calm down!!they are human not 
                    machine. After every 45 minutes a break of 10-15 minutes is given and from 12-45-13h45 the launch offered by
                    Microsoft itself...(Another occasion to explore Turkish cuisine if you are like me)..So what’s next????
